Project Desciption:

- Project to create a student feedback system, where the student enters his details on the webpage and those values are saved in my Oracle Database.
- Later I can check if a student record exists or not in the database with replies given through .jsp files.
- I implemented the MVC architecture with Struts framework for deploying a Servlet and storing values in the database through JDBC.
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, JQUERY/UI for the front-end.


Working:
The .rar file contains all the required documents to run my code.

I usually import the .war file in eclipse IDE nd then run the sur.html file in the web content folder of my project.

Also the link to execute the code is :

http://localhost:8080/Homework4/sur.jsp
by the tomcat server.

Flow of program:
1. Run the code through a browser. 
2. Fill in all the values for the text boxes (respective validation is done here)
3. After clicking the submit button, as per the data values entered the .jsp page is shown and the record is saved in my gmu Oracle database.
4. On clicking the student I.d. on this jsp page the data entered for the student is shown on the next .jsp page if it exists in the record. Or else no student record is shown on other .jsp file

The two needed .jar files are already in the lib folder of the project
